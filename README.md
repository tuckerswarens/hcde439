## What is Git? What is Github?

**Git** is a version control software that tracks changes to your files over time. It runs on your computer.

**GitHub** is a website that hosts Git repositories online and adds collaboration features. Think of it as a combination of:

- **Cloud storage** for your code (like Google Drive, but for code)
- **Version control** that tracks every change you make (like "Track Changes" in Word, but much more powerful)
- **Collaboration tools** that let multiple people work on the same project

### Some useful Git & Github terms

- **Repository (repo)**: A folder that contains your project files and the history of all changes made to them
- **Clone**: Download a copy of a repository to your computer so you can work on it
- **Commit**: Save a snapshot of your changes with a descriptive message (like saving a version of your work)
- **Push**: Upload your committed changes from your computer to GitHub's servers
- **GitHub Pages**: A free feature that turns your repository into a live website (e.g. paulate.github.io/hcde439)
