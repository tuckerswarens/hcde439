      Here is the image of my circut. Each LED is connected to its own resistor and shares a common ground.

      Here is my code snippet for the blinking lED's:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
      // setting the int timer to 0.2 sec
int timer = 200;
//this is the setup function 
void setup() {
  // this is a for loop that initializes pins 2 through 5 one at a time 
  for (int thisPin = 2; thisPin < 5; thisPin++) {
    //this tells the audrino to output power to the pin the four loop is on
    pinMode(thisPin, OUTPUT);
  }
  //these all are just telling the arduno to output power to the asociated pin when I call it later in the code
  pinMode(2, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(3, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(4, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(5, OUTPUT);

}
// the void loop is is required for the code to work and means the function does not have a return value
// the loop part means the code will repeat infinitly as long as the ardueno has power
void loop() {
  // this loop sets the int vaule from the 2 pin to the 5 pin one at a time
  for (int thisPin = 2; thisPin < 5; thisPin++) {
    // send power to the pin that the loop is on
    digitalWrite(thisPin, HIGH);
    // wait for the specified timer amount of time
    delay(timer);
    // turn the pin off
    digitalWrite(thisPin, LOW);
  }

  // loop from the highest pin to the lowest pin one at a time 
  for (int thisPin = 5; thisPin >= 2; thisPin--) {
    // turn the pin on:
    digitalWrite(thisPin, HIGH);
    //wait for the timer time
    delay(timer);
    // turn the pin off:
    digitalWrite(thisPin, LOW);
  }

  // loop from the lowest pin to the highest one at a time
  for (int thisPin = 2; thisPin < 5; thisPin++) {
    // turn the pin on:
    digitalWrite(thisPin, HIGH);
    // wait
    delay(timer);
    // turn the pin off:
    digitalWrite(thisPin, LOW);
    // wait
    delay(timer);
    //turn pin on
    digitalWrite(thisPin, HIGH);
    // wait
    delay(timer);
    // turn the pin off:
    digitalWrite(thisPin, LOW);
  }
//turn on pin 5
  digitalWrite(5, 1);
  // wait
  delay(timer);
  // turn pin 5 off
  digitalWrite(5,0);
  //turn pin 3 on
  digitalWrite(3, 1);
  // wait
  delay(timer);
  // turn pin 3 off
  digitalWrite(3, 0);
//turn pin 4 on
  digitalWrite(4, 1);
  // wait
  delay(timer);
  //turn pin 4 off
  digitalWrite(4, 0);
//turn pin 2 on
  digitalWrite(2, 1);
  // wait
  delay(timer);
  //turn pin 2 off
  digitalWrite(2, 0);
  
}

        1. the image next to this displays my voltage time graph showing the voltage up to 2 seconds. i figured this got the point acrossed and i thouhgt it would be a wast of time to go beyond that. 2. you could blink as many LED's independantly as your ardunio has ports so 19 if I counted correctly and the current draw would be dependant on the LED and resistor you use so there is no one answer for that but since each pin is firing one at a time and we can to some extent contol the amount of current with the resistor and led then we can try and keep it at 20 mA of current. 3. I could no longer tell that my led was blinking at 0.01 second intervals between blinks. 4. I did not use AI for the completion of this assignment.
